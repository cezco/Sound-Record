# SoundRecorder
Some web applications require an MP3 recorder to record sound directly from the user. The sound is converted to mono MP3 format with an adjustable sample rate and bit rate to reduce the output file size.

A page can contain several MP3 recorders that can be used interchangeably. The recording process can be paused and can be resumed to continue the recording process.
